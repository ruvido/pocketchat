# pocketChat
## Roadmap della app del Branco

To launch the chat locally

    docker compose up

To modify the chat, edit

    pb_public/index.html

### next steps
- have the same whatsapp/telegram ui with icon on the side, message on the other side, date on the line (you know  what i mean)
- dates do not appear on some devices (instead of date there is "invalid date"
- search all messages at the top
- reply to a message
- link should render correctly (ie you can click on them)
- reactions on messages (emoticon)
- admins can pin a message
- message can be edited and delete by owner and admin
- automatic scroll disable when reading old messages
- when reopening the chat, go to the last unread message without the need of reloading the page
